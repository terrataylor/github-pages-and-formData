## How to host your submission using Github Pages

1. Create a local branch named gh-pages:

    $ `git checkout -b gh-pages`

2. Push both your master branch and your gh-pages branch to Github:

    $ `git push origin master`  
    $ `git push origin gh-pages`

3. Find the link to your live site under the `Settings` menu at the top of your repository. Once you click `Setings`, scroll down until you see `Github Pages` and you should find the link where your site is now hosted. 
4. Click the `Edit` button on your main repository page to display fields where you will add your project description and the website URL.
